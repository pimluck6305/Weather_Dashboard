#  Problem Statement 
## üå¶Ô∏è Problem Statement (Revised Version)
 People often struggle to access comprehensive and up-to-date weather and environmental data in one place. Information such as temperature, humidity, air quality (AQI), and other environmental indicators is usually scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult and time-consuming to gather and interpret. 
 This lack of centralized, easy-to-understand data makes it challenging for individuals to make informed daily decisions ‚Äî especially for groups sensitive to environmental conditions, such as: 

* Outdoor workers and commuters 
* Individuals with asthma or other respiratory issues
* Fitness enthusiasts who exercise outdoors 

#  Proposed Solution 
## üåç Project Description (Revised for Weather & Environment Dashboard) 
 The Weather & Environment Dashboard is a user-friendly platform designed to integrate and display real-time environmental information in one place. 
 It combines data on: 
* Current weather conditions 
* Air Quality Index (AQI) 
* Environmental indicators such as humidity, UV index, and pollution levels 
The system retrieves data from reliable public APIs and presents it in a clear, visually engaging interface. 
 Users can:
* Search for data by current location or specific city 
* View environmental trends and health recommendations based on AQI and weather conditions 
* Plan outdoor or daily activities safely and more efficiently 
This dashboard helps users stay informed about environmental factors that may affect their health, comfort, and daily decisions.
